            The cabin radiates warmth and comfort, a refuge from the storm raging outside. Rain lashes against the windows, its rhythmic patter blending with the distant rumble of thunder. A crackling fireplace casts flickering shadows across rustic wooden walls lined with shelves brimming with ancient tomes and mysterious artifacts, their surfaces pulsing with an eerie luminescence.

The elder meets your gaze with a knowing smile, as if foreseeing the tale about to unfold.
